## Engine Swap Overview
<img src="https://github.com/dancornutt/Porsche944/blob/master/images/945-race-car.jpg" alt="Porsche 944 Turbo" title="Car Delivery" />

Getting the 07k in a 944 is fairly straight foward thanks to those who pinoneered it. You'll need the Boost Brothers Garage (BBG) Kit and some other items but there is no major cutting or fabrication needed other than the exhaust and intake plumbing.

The base engine is out of a 2014 automatic passat, it was supposed to have only 60k on it so we will see how it holds up. The down side is the drivers side engine mount interferes with the BBG bracket slightly. This will have to be clearenced around on of the sensors, auto transmission perhaps.


### General Information

The 07k engine is only used in the North American, South American, and Middle Eastern markets, as the replacement for the inline-four naturally aspirated 2.0 litre 8v.
identification
parts code prefix: 07K
engine displacement & engine configuration
2,480 cubic centimetres (151.3 cu in) inline five engine (R5/I5); bore x stroke: 82.5 by 92.8 millimetres (3.25 in × 3.65 in), stroke ratio: 0.89:1 - undersquare/long-stroke, 496.1 cc per cylinder
cylinder block & crankcase
GJL250 grey cast iron; two-part oil sump, die-forged steel crankshaft with six main bearings, water-cooled oil cooler
cylinder head & valvetrain
cast aluminium alloy; four valves per cylinder, 20 valves total, low-friction roller finger cam followers with automatic hydraulic valve clearance compensation, chain-driven (relay method, using two simplex roller chains) double overhead camshaft (DOHC), variable intake valve timing
aspiration
cast aluminium intake manifold, single throttle body with electronically controlled 'drive by wire' throttle butterfly valve
fuel system
common rail multi-point electronic sequential indirect fuel injection with five intake manifold-sited fuel injectors
ignition system & engine management
five individual direct-acting single spark coils with longlife spark plugs, Bosch Motronic engine control unit (ECU), secondary air injection during cold start phase to reduce emissions, single knock sensor
exhaust system
one-piece cast iron 5-into-1 exhaust manifold, ceramic catalytic converter, two heated oxygen sensors (three when equipped with California emissions) for permanent lambda control
DIN-rated motive power & torque outputs, ID codes
110 kilowatts (150 PS; 148 bhp) @ 5,000 rpm; 225 newton metres (166 lbf·ft) @ 3,750 rpm -- January 2005 (BGP/BGQ/BPR/BPS)
125 kilowatts (170 PS; 168 bhp) @ 5,700 rpm; 239 newton metres (176 lbf·ft) @ 4,250 rpm -- from May 2007 (CBT/CBU)

For this build the base engine is out of a 2014 automatic passat, it was supposed to have only 60k on it so we will see how it holds up. The drivers side BBG bracket needed to ground down slightly to clear the [oil pressure regulation valve](https://www.vwvortex.com/threads/oil-pressure-control-valve.9466496/). These are only on the late model engines and possibly automatic.


### Boost Brothers Kit

The [Boost Brothers Kit](https://www.boostbrothersgarage.com/products/944-07k-swap-full-kit) has custom parts needed for the swap. Later on they also offered a stand alone ECU and custom harness which was bought for this build.

* Engine Mounts - Right & Left w/ Isolators
* Billet Valve Cover w/ Breather Box
* Oil Filter Block w/ Gasket and Fittings
* Power Steering Pump Mount  
* 1.8T Power Steering Pulley
* Bellhousing w/ Pilot Bearing Adapter & Bearing
* Machined Upper Oil Pan (we will need your core)
 - -10 AN Oil Return Port Included
* Lower Oil Pan Sump w/ Baffles & Trap Doors
* Short Runner Cast Aluminum Intake Manifold
* Thermostat Neck Adapter
* Rear Coolant Flange
* Upgraded Tensioner Pulley
* Vacuum Pump Delete Kit
* SPEC Clutch & Flywheel


### Engine Installation Guide

07k installation tips:
1) Dont install the starter or RH engine mount until the engine is in the car
2) Mount the lower sump with the engine out of the car.
3) Lowering the crossmember makes it possible, dropping it completely makes it a piece of cake.
If the clutch disk isn't right on center, the tip of the driveshaft isnt going to line up with the pilot bearing. Also, we recommend removing the crossmember completely so you have a clear path to align the engine with the torque tube. And, use an engine leveler on your engine hoist to get it at the correct angle (fore/aft). It also needs to be clocked pretty close to 15 degrees (tilted toward psgr side) so that after you get the engine all the way back, you can get the four torque tube bolts into the back of the bellhousing. Another thing we found helps if the driveshaft spline doesnt want to go into the clutch disk, spin the crank using a strap wrench around the crank pulley while you push the engine back. I know you got further than this, but these tips might help others as well.
Other major things to install on the engine before dropping it in: upper oil pan and pickup, oil sump, flywheel, pilot bearing adapter, clutch disk, bellhousing, TOB. Optional: psgr side engine mount.

For the m8 (class 10.9) hex head bolts that fasten the engine mount brackets: 28-30 ft-lb.

For the one m10 (class 10.9) hex head bolt that fastens the driver side engine mount bracket: 55-60 ft-lb.

For the flywheel bolts are m10 x 1.0 (class 12.9), VW factory flywheel bolt torque spec, around 64 ft-lb or APR recommendation.

Note that the stainless steel bolts should not be torqued to the same values as class 10.9 bolts (that would break their heads off). Basically just snug them up and then maybe an addition 1/8 turn. Optionally, use Loctite blue to prevent them from backing out. Alan & BBG provided SS bolts for cosmetic reasons, in places where the loads are much lower.

## Accessories

Power Steering was removed. The 07k uses a dual belt system. The crank pulley drives the PS pump which has uses a pulley with two belt provisions, the other drives the water pump and alternator.

Our car has manual steering. Not sure exactly how this will pan out but Cjar from the RL forum said this:
My car also has manual steering, I pulled apart an ebay AC compressor and just mounted the front half with the stock VW pulley to hold the place and make the belt routing complete. 


### Accessory Bracket

The original 07k accessory bracket will need the top half cut down. This is required as the BBG intake manifold interferes with it. The BBG manifold is designed to clear the 944 hood so chopping the acc. bracket isn't a bit deal. For this build a sawzall was used with a longer metal blade. Pro-tip: go very very slow on cutting speed. Going fast will clog up the blade teeth and render it useless.


### Alternator

The donor engine did not come with an alternator. A new stock 07k alternator p/n: 211254 (2-11254) from TYC, found at Rock Auto.


### Breather

There are two schools of thought on the breather system or crankcase ventilation
- 1) Vent to atmosphere and use a catch can to collect excess oil vapors
- 2) Use recirculation system to separate oil vapors in crankcase blowby, plumb "air" back into into and put oil back into pan.

In either method, crankcase venting will happen at the valve cover & at the adapter block both are -10 AN lines.

For this build we are going down the route of option #2 using an air/oil separator seen below. More to come as we.
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLVpvzJ0vXCWMxkf3mz68OsQ9i_QHLeLusuGXtmWPSQ89rK3-5MemyPkV_-aVPV6n9om8B20l9bMqQ0CUM8io9eABX99ZtD2vPoAUA4UaOo3XrhipMMma17JR7J2jFkOuz9pERV_OQmfmvPzgu2URhH1=s140-no?authuser=0"></img>
</div>


### Crank Pulley

The stock crank pulley definately works but there have been documented cases of throwing belts at higher RPMs. To get around this use the TTRS/RS3 crank pulley, p/n: 07K105243H. Audi uses a viscous center pulley to reduce the high RPM vibration and keep your belts, well belted.


### Power Steering Pump

The original power steering pump will not work with this swap. The swap allows use of a 1.8t power steering pulley and to have it relocated to the lower most location on the accessory bracket.


### Valve Cover

The BBG kit uses a billet valve cover. This is required for clearance of the stock 944 hood. At the rear of the valve cover is a -10 AN line to allow for crankcase venting. See Breather section. The BBG kit comes with all required hardware.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



## Drivetrain
Other than the flywheel, bellhousing, clutch, and throw out bearing no other driveline modifications are required with the BBG kit.


### Bellhousing

The custom bellhousing was sourced from BBG. I would recommend test installing the starter. Mine needed a bit of clearancing (small amount) for the starter to sit flush, don't forget the starter shim from BBG.


### Clutch

Clutch kit from BBG was used, it contains:
- SPEC 02M pressure plate
- SPEC 944 Turbo disk


### Flywheel

The Aluminum flywheel was sourced from BBG. We aren't going with the 8 bolt TTRS forged crank so the stock 07k 6 bolt flyweel was used.
- SPEC 02M aluminum flywheel (SV81A)

To give a little extra insurance, ARP crank bolts are to be used. ARP p/n: 1512801 appears to be the correct fasteners for this application.

Installation Tips:
  1) Make sure you have the crank position sensor impulse rotor installed
  2) Do not use the stock flywheel shims with new flywheel & clutch kit


### Throwout Bearing

The throwout brearing is from a Solstice GXP hydraulic TOB (24234308). To use it a hydralic adaptor, Kappadapt Stainless Clutch Fitting adapter to -4AN with 2 o-rings (CHK101-2) is needed. An adaptor is needed from the Kappadapt, Earl’s AT9919BFEERL, Adapter M12 x 1.0 to -4AN. The line from the slave cylinder to TOB is Jegs 635158, 24” stainless braided Teflon lined hydraulic hose with -4AN ends (one straight, one 90).

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



## Fuel System

Most of the fuel system is just plug and plug other than the firewall mounted fuel regulator.


### Fuel Injectors

Our base engine didn't come with a fuel rail or injectors. So we sourced the same injectors BBG used [Siemens Deka](https://www.fiveomotorsport.com/siemens-deka-high-flow-extended-nozzle/) 60lb/hr injectors for the build.

When installing the fuel injectors, Alan said:
For our cast aluminum manifold, make sure you install the injectors into the intake manifold first, individually. Also best to use some sort of lube on the injector o-rings such as a dielectric grease. The injector ports are the same size as the ones in the factory manifold, but require some effort to insert the injectors. If you leave the injectors in the rail and try to install it as an assembly you risk them not seating into the manifold properly.


### Fuel Regulator

Following the BBG parts list we purchased a fuel regulator and gauge to help troubleshoot any fuel issues should they pop up.

BBG set fuel pressure to 43.5 psi for the turbo tune with large 60 lb/hr injectors.


### Fuel Rail

We could have spent money at the junk yard for a stock fuel rail but where's the fun in that? Billet things are nice so the IE billet fuel rail was sourced.


### Fuel Pump

Most likely we will opt for the Bosche 044 pump but that is still a future purchase.


### Fuel Lines

We are using Vibrant -6 lines, same in the BBG spreadsheet. We may cover the portion near the exhaust with some type of thermal barrier.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



## Ignition System

The only modification required is different coil packs. This is needed to get the proper hood clearance.


### Coil Packs

The 07k uses coil over plugs.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



## Turbo System

Our turbo system isn't completely finalized. Initially the Lamborghini header was going to be used with a v-band and internally gated turbo. The Lamborghini header almost bolts up to the 07k. Only one stud doesn't quite align. When it all came together it was decided a good clamp up for the exhaust is needed.


### Turbo
We will be using the same turbo as Alan, Garrett [G25-660](https://www.atpturbo.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=tp&Product_Code=GRT-TBO-637&Category_Code=G) reverse rotation turbo, part # 871390-5011S G25-660. Turbo is oil and water cooled, includes -4AN oil feed fitting and -6AN coolant/water fittings. 


### Exhaust Manifold

We will be using a SPA manifold.
Longer exhaust head studs are needed, m8 x 1.25 55mm long. We did fancy things and bought inconel ones because, you know race car.


### Wastegate

External waste gate will is Tial MVS 38mm vband
- T3 to v-band adaptor is needed between the turbo and header

* Optional - Use 2 bolt 38mm to [vband adaptor](https://www.extremepsi.com/store/Torque-Solution-38mm-2-bolt-to-38mm-V-band-MVS-Wastegate-Adapter.html) for wastegate and v-band wastegate to clock wastegate to exit rear


### Exhaust System

More details coming "soon"


### Intercooler

More details coming "soon"


### Intake Manifold

The BBG custom intake manifold was used. This manifold has (2) 1/4" NPT ports and (4) 1/8" NPT ports.


### Intake Piping

More details coming "soon"

## Cooling System

Per Alan's post on the RL forum: 

All Cars
- Largest fitting on rear coolant flange -> upper radiator port (there are some formed hoses I found that work awesome for this, snaking around the firewall and steering shaft without rubbing on anything) Here it is: Dayco 72365 will get you most of the way from the back of the engine up to the radiator. Depending on what radiator you're running, you will probably need an adapter and a second hose to finish the run. I used a billet aluminum 1-1/4" coupler made by ICT Billet, with Gates heat shrink hose clamps, since there's no reason to pull this splice apart for service.
- Lower radiator port -> thermostat neck (another formed hose, I will update here when I find the part number) Here it is: Dayco 72193.
- Steam vent (smallest port on rear flange) -> small vertical port on back of expansion tank (I used a piece of 6mm or 7mm ID silicone hose for this).
- Cap the 3/4" port on the OE thermostat housing (I bought a set of coolant bypass caps from an auto parts store, and put silicone on a small one to push inside the port, and then hose clamped a 3/4" cap on the outside.)
- And, pick one of the following options:

Option 1. No heat and no water-cooled turbo
3/4” outlet on rear flange -> thermostat housing bypass fitting*

Option 2. With heat and no water-cooled turbo
3/4” outlet on rear flange -> 3/4" inlet in heater valve (GM 12380318)**
3/4" and 5/8" fittings on heater valve -> heater core ports
5/8" outlet of heater valve -> thermostat housing bypass fitting*

Option 3. No heat and with water-cooled turbo
3/4" outlet on rear flange -> 5/8" x 5/8" x 3/8" tee (Dorman 47147)
Water outlet on oil filter block -> turbo water inlet
Turbo water outlet -> 3/8" port on tee
5/8" port on tee -> thermostat housing bypass fitting*

Option 4. With heat and water-cooled turbo
3/4" outlet on rear flange -> 3/4" inlet in heater valve (GM part # 12380318)**
3/4" and 5/8" fittings on heater valve -> heater core ports

5/8" outlet of heater valve -> 5/8" x 5/8" x 3/8" tee (Dorman 47147)
Water outlet on oil filter block -> turbo water inlet
Turbo water outlet -> 3/8" port on tee
5/8" port on tee -> thermostat housing bypass fitting*

* bypass fitting can be made by cutting off the end of the steel bypass tube that mounts into the thermostat housing, and welding on a steel 5/8" barb fitting (such as Dorman 56152). See pic below. There is also a 3/4" version of this fitting, which may work better for options 1 and 3, along with the 3/4" version of the Dorman tee.
** GM part is vacuum actuated. Substitute a 4-port cable-actuated heater valve if necessary. I mounted mine above the bellhousing on the passenger side, right near the heater core ports on the firewall. You can easily find 5/8" and 3/4" formed hoses at your local parts store that will make the connections (I found a couple of short 90 degree ones).


### Thermostat Housing

The thermostat Housing cover will need to be switched to a 1.8t style cover which will route the coolant at a better angle than stock. I bought the BBG aluminum housing cover but I wasn't a fan of the part so I opted for a new $4 plastic one.


### Rear Outlet

Rear outlet was sourced from BBG, it is held on with two 10mm nylon locking nuts. Don't forget the seal and don't over tighten.


### Adaptor Block (Coolant)

More details coming "soon"


### Cooling Routing

More details coming "soon"


### Radiator

More details coming "soon"

## Oiling System

The 2012 07k engine used for the sway has an oil pressure regulating valve. The driver's engine mount had to be clearanced to allow the bracket to work with the valve. The valve when not hooked up defaults to high pressure mode which is what will be ran at all times.


### Adaptor Block (Oil)

More details coming "soon"


### Oil Pan

The 07k engine has and upper pan and a lower pan. In the BBG kit the upper pan is reworked and the lower is completely fabricated to allow for clearance to the 944 cross member.
When fitting the upper pan, it was found out that the original hardware won't quite clear the welds. We opted for new cap bolts and washers for fasten the 8 outer bolts that were not internal to the engine. The bolts used were (8) M8x1.25 25. Also inspect around the oil return bung, I had to slighly file down the aluminum weld such that the upper pan would sit flush.

<h1>Clean Surfaces</h1>


<h1>Install Upper Pan</h1>

It was recommended by Mike at BBG that you remove the rear lower and upper chain covers. This would provide a simple "drop in" for the upper pan vs trying to maintain a good seal while attaching to two perpendicular surfaces (block and rear lower chain cover).

For the oil pans and chain covers, volkswagen D 176 501 A1 was used. D 154 103 A1 will be used for the timing cover.

Steps:
1) Disassemble everyting you need to
2) Prep sealant surfaces (both sides of upper pan, block and lower pan by removing debris and cleaning.
