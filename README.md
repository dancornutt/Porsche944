<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project started as a partnership with Dana and Dan to turn wrenches and get some track time in. We liked the idea of endurance racing and splitting the cost would make it cheaper and more fun. In the words of Ricky Bobby, "I wanna go fast" but honestly we don't need to be first.


### Lemons

24hrs of Lemons is a endurance race of "junk" cars. It was an event that offers a low cost of entry lots of track time. Judging by the YouTube videos it looks like a lot of fun "racing" with other gearheads. The hunt was on for a cheap car that would git the criteria of $500.


### Base Car

Our purchased car is a 1986 944 turbo that was hit with the ugly stick. It needed to be put back together after the owner, "had a heart attack while doing a headgasket replacement." Cool head gasket isn't too bad. If we sold things we didn't need like the black leather sport interiors we could recoup some the cost of blowing the $500 budget. Unfortunately there were some skeltons in the closet. These skeltons were so plentiful and dangerous that we ultimately decided to not spend all of our time building a shit box. We'd keep costs low where possible but we wanted a safe and reliable car.

<!-- Engine -->
## Engine

With the original engine in full sketch mode in need of rebuilding the decision of dumping thousands into rebuilding an engine developed in the 70s or engine swapping was simple. Engine swap it. Knee jerk reaction was ls it and move but as Jordan Perterson said, "Life is Suffering" so why not make it more complicated. Some smart folks on the interwebs started kicking around the idea of a turbo 5 cylinder in the 944. Hearing the sweet sweet sound of 80's urquattros was a big motivator. It was decided, join the early few to put up money for the kit. Big thanks to Alan, without him it would just be forum chatter.

### Boost Brothers Kit

The Boost Brothers Kit has custom parts needed for the swap. Later on they also offered a stand alone ECU and custom harness which was opted for.
* Bellhousing
* Intake Manifold
* Motor Mounts
* Custom Upper and Lower Oil Pans
* Valve Cover
* Rear Coolant Fitting
* etc.

### Engine Development

Being true to the race car, it was decided AC and heat were not necessary. So we decided to not plumb those systems and remove everything we could.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Chassis

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.


### Brakes

The brakes were not operation when we purchased the car. The seller stated they didn't work because the engine wasn't running. Yeah. Red flag.


### Clutch

The Clutch was also not operational when we purchased the car. It went straight to the floor.

The BBG kit supplied a new flywheel, clutch disk and pressure plate. Simple purchase.


### Suspension

Suspension stuff here.


### Steering

Steering stuff here.
